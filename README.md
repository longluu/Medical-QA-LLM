Medical-QA-extractive
==============================

The purpose of this repositories is to train LLMs on extractive Question-Answering in biomedical domain.

# 1. Model

# 2. Dataset
## 2.1. COVID-QA
This dataset contains question - answer pairs regarding COVID-19. The dataset can be found here: https://github.com/deepset-ai/COVID-QA. 

## 2.2 BioASQ

# 3. Training setup
## 3.1 Environment
Here I use Python version 3.9.2. All the dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
You also need to install the repo as a package `pip install -e .`.

## 3.2 Run the code
An example to run the training code is

# 4. Results
The fine-tuned models and brief results can be found at my huggingface page https://huggingface.co/longluu.
You can also look at the notebooks folder for training and test results.
